            Perhaps one of the best looking motorcycles on the market today is the Ducati Panigale.
            Powered by a 955 cc twin cylinder liquid-cooled engine, the motorcycle tops out at 169 miles per hour.

            I had the pleasure of visiting Japan last June and it was absolutely amazing.
One of the most memorable aspects of the trip was the food, specifically the ramen which we ate a lot of. Of the five ramen shops we visited, Ginza Kagari was one of the best. 
The broth is rich and creamy and the noodles are cooked to perfection. While it is pricey, it is definitely worth the trip.

  <p> In my opinion, takoyaki is one of the best appetizers out there. 10/10 recommend.

  <p> It looks like water... IT'S NOT WATER. I found this out when I was in Hong Kong and it was quite a shocker. I was expecting the cool crisp taste of water and was instead met with the taste of citrus. Quite disgusting when you're not expecting it. I've had it since then and it has grown on me.</p>
